; The default connections to the test databases. Used by tests based on  BasicDataServiceTest.cs.
; Read by code in DefaultTestConns.cs

; I'm using a local MSDE server for testing. Obviously, you'll have to modify
; the conn string to whatever MS SQL server is available to you.

; As to SQLite, if the conn string here is empty, it will work anyway using a temporary
; file for the DB.  If you want the resulting DB to persist (e.g. for performance testing),
; specify a conn string like this: 

; SqliteConnection="URI=file:<path_to_your_file>,version=3"
